    "# Community of Learners  \n",
    "\n",
    "What I have appreciated most looking back to my-6-months-ago self is the opportunity to learn. The concept of continuous learning has always been embedded in my training as a PhD, in which I am grateful for. But learning alone can be though. So, I am thankful for the community of learners in the Twin Cities area, particularly in [Deep Learning](https://www.meetup.com/Twin-Cities-Deep-Learning-Study-Group/) and [R](https://www.meetup.com/AnalyzeThis/). I would recommend you to find those community in your area as well!    \n",
    "\n",
    "I was also given the opportunity to present on several different machine learning topics through these two communities. It has been a wonderful learning experience to distill them [\"as simple as possible, but not simpler\"](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/05/13/einstein-simple/) and transpired it to others.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In sharing the topics, I often use [streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) as my UI of choice. If you are interested in learning more about it, feel free to look at both [my earlier blog post](https://atunanggara.github.io/blog/python/streamlit/2020/06/12/streamlit-tutorial.html) and this [simple TensorFlow tutorial on sentiment analysis using deep learning in my repository](https://github.com/atunanggara/simple_dl_sentiment_analysis_lecture).  \n",

    "# Type-hinting in Python  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the past 6 months, I have grown to embrace [type hinting](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/) in my Python code writing. As someone who works with data, providing `hints` on the kind of input(s) and output(s) of my code really helps me with streamlining my process and my code writing. Definitely check it out and follow along this [excellent tutorial](https://realpython.com/python-type-checking/) if you are interested.  \n",

    "# A blog recommendation  \n",

    "I highly recommend [Vicki Boykis's takes on tech news that are rooted in humanism, nuance, context, rationality, and a little fun](https://vicki.substack.com/). Her latest writing, [The rise of the non-expert expert](https://vicki.substack.com/p/the-rise-of-the-non-expert-expert), is quite insightful in realizing the importance of the fundamentals in tech. She will be one of the keynote speaker for [rstudio::global(2021)](https://blog.rstudio.com/2020/10/16/rstudio-global-2021/). Plus, [she](https://vicki.substack.com/p/the-average-opinion-of-10k-people) introduced me to [bardcore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kbj4bulZX2Y)! "
