    "It has been a tough couple of weeks for me to grapple with [events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_George_Floyd) that unfolded about 30 minutes away from where I live. This Martin Luther King Jr. quote that I read on [Chris Damian's blog post](https://chrisdamian.net/2020/05/29/reflections-on-a-second-night-of-fires/) resonated with me:    \n",

    "> “Let me say as I’ve always said, and I will always continue to say, that riots are socially destructive and self-defeating. … But in the final analysis, a riot is the language of the unheard. And what is it that America has failed to hear? It has failed to hear that the plight of the Negro poor has worsened over the last few years. It has failed to hear that the promises of freedom and justice have not been met. And it has failed to hear that large segments of white society are more concerned about tranquility and the status quo than about justice, equality, and humanity. And so in a real sense our nation’s summers of riots are caused by our nation’s winters of delay. And as long as America postpones justice, we stand in the position of having these recurrences of violence and riots over and over again.”\n",

    "I first heard about [streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) from a data scientist in the area. Supposedly, it can create an interactive web python app in a simplified manner. So, I went ahead and run through the [tutorial](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/latest/getting_started.html) to understand more on its capability. Since I am familiar with [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/), I am going to compare it with streamlit in this introduction. \n",
    "\n",
    "First off, compared to [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/), [streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) is simpler when it comes to creating a dynamic web app. In flask, it is recommended to save the python file in `.py` files in root and the [html](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp) file in `.html` files in `templates` folder. This is partly due to html being a verbose markup language. On the other hand, streamlit uses [GitHub flavored markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) and both python and markdown co-exist in one single python file. Markdown syntax can render rich formatted content in a concise manner. Of course, combining python with markdown texts can be confusing at first. But, if one is already familiar with [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/), this format should come naturally."

However, if we want to keep things simple and get quick feedback from other teams, streamlit should be the way to go.  \n",
