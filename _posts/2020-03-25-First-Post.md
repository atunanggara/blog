# First Post - Setting up fastpages blog  

This first post will be about my set up for this blog using [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages) and how I stumble into it.  

## Introduction  

In the past couple of weeks, the [Introduction to Machine Learning for Coders](https://course18.fast.ai/ml) by Jeremy Howard have helped me better understand Random Forest technique and provided me with a nice introduction to deep learning.

Then, [covid-19](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) happened.  

Since I am a fan of [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/), I ended up listening to [Jeremy's YouTube summary on the situation](https://youtu.be/GZ0yNMnvwqY). At the end of his video, he pointed his audience to the [fast.ai forum](https://forums.fast.ai/c/covid-19/52). 

When I searched through it, I ended up going through the beautiful [covid-19 Dashboards](https://covid19dashboards.com/) website. The beauty and simplicity of the format is what really sold me into creating my blog using this [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages) format. 

## Setting up

In terms of [setting up fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages#setup-instructions), it is pretty self-explanatory. I am thankful to [Abdul Majed](https://twitter.com/1littlecoder) for his nice [walk-through video](https://youtu.be/L0boq3zqazI) that helped reassure me that I am following the right path.  

However, I find myself stumbling through what would be the next step for me once I have the blog up and running. So, here is my attempt to share with you what I have done to customize this blog. 

### Main page

The main page can be accessed under `index.html` on the main repository:

Once I hit the `Edit this file` button, I used my markdown skill to edit the pages:
