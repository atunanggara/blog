<h1 id="Introduction">Introduction<a class="anchor-link" href="#Introduction"> </a></h1><p>It has been so long since I update this blog that github warned me about the possibility of its action being disabled soon. So, it is enough of a nudge for me to update this site for my own edification.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.fast.ai/2019/05/13/blogging-advice/">Rachel Thomas</a> wrote, <em>"I usually advise new bloggers that your target audience could be you-6-months-ago."</em> So, what would I say to me back in April 24, 2020?</p>

<h1 id="Community-of-Learners">Community of Learners<a class="anchor-link" href="#Community-of-Learners"> </a></h1><p>What I have appreciated most looking back to my-6-months-ago self is the ability to learn. The concept of continuous learning has always been embedded in my training as a PhD, in which I am grateful for. But learning alone can be though. So, I am grateful for the community of learners in the Twin Cities area, particularly in <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Twin-Cities-Deep-Learning-Study-Group/">Deep Learning</a> and <a href="https://www.meetup.com/AnalyzeThis/">R</a>.</p>
<p>I was also given the opportunity to teach several different machine learning topics through these two communities. It has been really a wonderful learning experience to drill down the topics to an easy bit of nuggets and transpire it to others.</p>
<p>If you are interested in streamlit as a UI for your data science project and method of teaching, feel free to look at both <a href="https://atunanggara.github.io/blog/python/streamlit/2020/06/12/streamlit-tutorial.html">my earlier blog post</a> and this <a href="https://github.com/atunanggara/simple_dl_sentiment_analysis_lecture">simple TensorFlow tutorial on sentiment analysis using deep learning in github</a>.</p>
<h1 id="Type-hinting-in-Python">Type-hinting in Python<a class="anchor-link" href="#Type-hinting-in-Python"> </a></h1><p>In the past 6 months, I have grown to embrace <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/">type hinting</a> in my Python code writing. As someone who works with data, providing <code>hints</code> on the kind of input(s) and output(s) of my code really helps me with streamlining my process and my code writing. Definitely check it out and follow along this <a href="https://realpython.com/python-type-checking/">excellent tutorial</a> if you are interested.</p>
<h1 id="Tech-related-blogs-to-read">Tech-related blogs to read<a class="anchor-link" href="#Tech-related-blogs-to-read"> </a></h1><p>I highly recommend <a href="https://vicki.substack.com/">Vicki Boykis's writing on tech and humanities</a>. Her latest writing, <a href="https://vicki.substack.com/p/the-rise-of-the-non-expert-expert">The rise of the non-expert expert</a> is quite insightful for me. Plus, <a href="https://vicki.substack.com/p/the-average-opinion-of-10k-people">she</a> introduced me to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kbj4bulZX2Y">bardcore</a>!</p>
