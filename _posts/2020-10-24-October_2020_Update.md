<h1 id="Introduction">Introduction<a class="anchor-link" href="#Introduction"> </a></h1><p>It has been so long since I update this blog. Earlier this week, github warned me about the possibility of its action being disabled soon due to inactivity in this repository. So, <em>that</em> is enough of a nudge for me to update this site. I want to tell my own self, via this post, "I am still learning."</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.fast.ai/2019/05/13/blogging-advice/">Rachel Thomas</a> wrote, <em>"I usually advise new bloggers that your target audience could be you-6-months-ago."</em> So, what have I learned since April 24, 2020?</p>

<h1 id="Community-of-Learners">Community of Learners<a class="anchor-link" href="#Community-of-Learners"> </a></h1><p>What I have appreciated most looking back to my-6-months-ago self is the opportunity to learn. The concept of continuous learning has always been embedded in my training as a PhD, in which I am grateful for. But learning alone can be though. So, I am thankful for the community of learners in the Twin Cities area, particularly in <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Twin-Cities-Deep-Learning-Study-Group/">Deep Learning</a> and <a href="https://www.meetup.com/AnalyzeThis/">R</a>. I would recommend you to find those communities in your area as well!</p>
<p>I was also given the opportunity to present on several different machine learning topics through these two communities. It has been a wonderful learning experience to distill them <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/05/13/einstein-simple/">"as simple as possible, but not simpler"</a> and transpire it to others.</p>
<p>In sharing the topics, I often use <a href="https://www.streamlit.io/">streamlit</a> as my UI of choice. If you are interested in learning more about it, feel free to look at both <a href="https://atunanggara.github.io/blog/python/streamlit/2020/06/12/streamlit-tutorial.html">my earlier blog post</a> and this <a href="https://github.com/atunanggara/simple_dl_sentiment_analysis_lecture">simple TensorFlow tutorial on sentiment analysis using deep learning in my repository</a>.</p>
<h1 id="Type-hinting-in-Python">Type-hinting in Python<a class="anchor-link" href="#Type-hinting-in-Python"> </a></h1><p>In the past 6 months, I have grown to embrace <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/">type hinting</a> in my Python code writing. As someone who works with data, providing <code>hints</code> on the kind of input(s) and output(s) of my code really helps me with streamlining my process and my code writing. Definitely check it out and follow along this <a href="https://realpython.com/python-type-checking/">excellent tutorial</a> if you are interested.</p>
<h1 id="A-blog-recommendation">A blog recommendation<a class="anchor-link" href="#A-blog-recommendation"> </a></h1><p>I highly recommend <a href="https://vicki.substack.com/">Vicki Boykis's takes on tech news that are rooted in humanism, nuance, context, rationality, and a little fun</a>. Her latest writing, <a href="https://vicki.substack.com/p/the-rise-of-the-non-expert-expert">The rise of the non-expert expert</a>, is quite insightful in realizing the importance of the fundamentals in tech. She will be one of the keynote speaker for <a href="https://blog.rstudio.com/2020/10/16/rstudio-global-2021/">rstudio::global(2021)</a>. Plus, <a href="https://vicki.substack.com/p/the-average-opinion-of-10k-people">she</a> introduced me to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kbj4bulZX2Y">bardcore</a>!</p>
