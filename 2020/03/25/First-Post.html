<h1 id="first-post---setting-up-my-own-blog">First Post - Setting up my own blog</h1>

<p>This first post will be about my set up for this blog using <a href="https://github.com/fastai/fastpages">fastpages</a> and how I stumble into it.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>In the past couple of weeks, the <a href="https://course18.fast.ai/ml">Introduction to Machine Learning for Coders</a> by Jeremy Howard have helped me better understand Random Forest technique and provided me with a nice introduction to deep learning.</p>

<p>Then, <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019">covid-19</a> happened.</p>

<p>Since I am a fan of <a href="https://www.fast.ai/">fast.ai</a>, I ended up listening to <a href="https://youtu.be/GZ0yNMnvwqY">Jeremyâ€™s YouTube summary on the situation</a>. At the end of his video, he pointed his audience to the <a href="https://forums.fast.ai/c/covid-19/52">fast.ai forum</a>.</p>

<p>When I searched through it, I ended up going through the beautiful <a href="https://covid19dashboards.com/">covid-19 Dashboards</a> website. The beauty and simplicity of the format is what really sold me into creating my blog using this <a href="https://github.com/fastai/fastpages">fastpages</a> format.</p>

<h2 id="setting-it-up">Setting it up</h2>

<p>In terms of <a href="https://github.com/fastai/fastpages#setup-instructions">setting up fastpages</a>, it is pretty self-explanatory. I am thankful to <a href="https://twitter.com/1littlecoder">Abdul Majed</a> for his nice <a href="https://youtu.be/L0boq3zqazI">walk-through video</a> that helped reassure me that I am following the right path.</p>

<p>However, I find myself stumbling through what would be the next step for me once I have the blog up and running. So, here is my attempt to share with you what I have done to customize this blog.</p>
