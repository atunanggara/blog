            "content": "First Post - Setting up fastpages blog . This first post will be about my set up for this blog using fastpages and how I stumble into it. . Introduction . In the past couple of weeks, the Introduction to Machine Learning for Coders by Jeremy Howard have helped me better understand Random Forest technique and provided me with a nice introduction to deep learning. . . Then, covid-19 happened. . Since I am a fan of fast.ai, I ended up listening to Jeremy’s YouTube summary on the situation. At the end of his video, he pointed his audience to the fast.ai forum. . When I searched through it, I ended up going through the beautiful covid-19 Dashboards website. The beauty and simplicity of the format is what really sold me into creating my blog using this fastpages format. . Setting up . In terms of setting up fastpages, it is pretty self-explanatory. I am thankful to Abdul Majed for his nice walk-through video that helped reassure me that I am following the right path. . However, I find myself stumbling through what would be the next step for me once I have the blog up and running. So, here is my attempt to share with you what I have done to customize this blog. . Main page . The main page can be accessed under index.html on the main repository: . Once I hit the Edit this file button, I used my markdown skill to edit the pages: . ![edit pages](/blog/images/Index-playaround.png “”) . Two things to note: . line 6 shows me using &lt;!-- in the beginning and --&gt; at the end to comment the index.html file. Since markdown do not have the capacity to comment, I used html comment tag instead. | If you are not familiar with markdown, here are some guides from fastpages or from github | . About Me . The About Me page can be accessed under _pages/about.md on the main repository: ![about me](/blog/images/blog_about.png “”) . Repeat the process on the Main Page. . Summary . I hope that this post will help others who are trying to set up their first fastpages site. Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn if you have any questions! .",

          "content": "Hi and welcome to my professional blog! My name is Atun Anggara and I am a data scientist with experience in NLP, statistics, and various machine learning methods. . I got interested in data science after receiving my Ph.D. in the computational chemical engineering catalysis area and did my post-doc in the First Year of Studies program at the University of Notre Dame. . The experience brought me the opportunity to work with various data science techniques. Sentiment analysis, n-gram analysis, and topic modeling were some of the techniques that I have performed on various textual data, including students’ reflection and survey results. Creating statistical summary and Tableau dashboard for various stakeholders in the university have also been a part of my experience. . Currently, I am continuing to level up my data science skills. That includes being a part of the deep learning study group in the community. . Feel free to reach out and connect with me via LinkedIn. .",
