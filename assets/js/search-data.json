This first post will be about how I set up my Index Page and About Me for this fastpages site and how I stumble upon it. . Introduction . In the past couple of weeks, the Introduction to Machine Learning for Coders by Jeremy Howard have helped me better understand Random Forest technique and provided me with a nice introduction to deep learning. . . Then, Covid-19 happened. . Since I am a fan of fast.ai, I listened to Jeremy’s YouTube summary on the situation. At the end of his video, he pointed his audience to the fast.ai forum. . When I searched through it, I stumbled upon the beautiful Covid-19 Dashboards website. The beauty and simplicity of the format is what really sold me into creating my site using this fastpages. .

          "content": "Hi and welcome to my professional blog! My name is Atun Anggara and I am a data scientist with experience in NLP, statistics, and various machine learning methods. . I got interested in data science after receiving my Ph.D. in the computational chemical engineering catalysis area and did my post-doc in the First Year of Studies program at the University of Notre Dame. . The experience brought me the opportunity to work with various data science techniques. Sentiment analysis, n-gram analysis, and topic modeling were some of the techniques that I have performed on various textual data, including students’ reflection and survey results. Creating statistical summary and Tableau dashboard for various stakeholders in the university have also been a part of my experience. . Currently, I am continuing to level up my data science skills. That includes being a part of the deep learning study group in the community. . Feel free to reach out and connect with me via LinkedIn. .",
