Hi and welcome to my professional blog! I am a data scientist with experience in NLP, statistics, and various machine learning methods. 

I got interested in data science after receiving my Ph.D. in the [computational chemical engineering catalysis area](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PyTERHUAAAAJ&hl=en) and doing my post-doc in the First Year of Studies program at the [University of Notre Dame](www.nd.edu). 

The experience brought me the opportunity to work with various data science techniques. Sentiment analysis, n-gram analysis, and topic modeling are some of the techniques that I have performed on various textual data, including students' reflection and survey results. Creating statistical summary and [Tableau dashboard](https://www.tableau.com/) for various stakeholders in the university have also been a part of my experience. 

Currently, I am continuing to round up my data science skills. That includes being a part of the [deep learning study group in the community](https://www.meetup.com/Twin-Cities-Deep-Learning-Study-Group/events/).
