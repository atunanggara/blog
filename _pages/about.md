I got interested in data science after receiving my Ph.D. in the [computational chemical engineering catalysis area](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PyTERHUAAAAJ&hl=en) and did my post-doc in the First Year of Studies program at the [University of Notre Dame](www.nd.edu).

My post-doc experience provided me the opportunity to work with various data science techniques. Sentiment analysis, n-gram analysis, and topic modeling were some of the techniques that I have performed on various textual data, including students' reflection and survey results. Creating statistical summary and [Tableau dashboard](https://www.tableau.com/) for various stakeholders in the university have also been a part of my experience.


Currently, I am continuing to level up my data science skills. That includes being a part of the [deep learning study group in the community](https://www.meetup.com/Twin-Cities-Deep-Learning-Study-Group/events/).
